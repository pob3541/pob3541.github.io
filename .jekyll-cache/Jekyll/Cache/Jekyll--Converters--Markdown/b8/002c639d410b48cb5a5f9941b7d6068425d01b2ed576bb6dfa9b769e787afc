I"P<p>Maria Kloiber is a well known ghost and Minnesotan that frequently haunts Fuller St in Brookline, MA. She has also been observed haunting BU campus as a “student”.</p>

<p>Be wary and exercise extreme caution when encountering this bogey woman. Do not trust her pronounciations as they will lead you astray. For example she will pronounce ‘roof’ as ‘ruf’but oddly enough she will say ‘rooftop’ and not ‘ruftop’.</p>

<p>To rid yourself of this apparation we recommend a carrot and stick approach. It should be known that she is afraid of turkeys. In her hauntings she will often claim that turkeys stare at her from ‘ruftops’. So if she must be dispelled lure her to low ground with luke warm pancakes, waffles, plain plasta, or skull vodka and attract Brookline turkeys to the highground using the previously mentioned food.</p>

<p>If this fails, pelt her with potatos.</p>

<p>Please see attached photos to recognize said ghost and attached figures also demonstrate escape tactics.</p>
